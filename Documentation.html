       <p>This white paper seeks to provide an overview of
   technical documentation for a product or service.</p>
       <p>It also
   highlights the tools and technologies used in technical
   documentation as well as challenges in this field.
   Technical documentation is an integral part of the
   introduction of a product or service to the market.</p>
   <p> An
   inefficient documentation process can have a significant
   effect on the financial success of a product or service. </p>

        <p>Writing correct and applicable content with supporting
   illustrations is a real challenge as this not only requires
   effective technical writing skills but also product/domain
   knowledge, skills to interpret engineering drawings,
   visualization skills, and also an end user point of view,
   since eventually it is the end user who needs to
   understand technical manuals and documents</p>

        <p>Traditional publishing systems such as word processing
   and desktop publishing software were used in early
   stages but they have a lot of limitations that waste
   organizational time and resources</p>

        <p>Manual updates: Copying/pasting content is a common
   method for making changes when using desktop
   publishing. Although this method may add to authoring
   efficiency when creating a standalone document, it
   greatly complicates the maintenance of documents.
   Changes to content require authors to manually search
   and update redundant content in multiple sections within
   multiple documents. Changes are the writer’s nightmare
   and account for a major portion of authors’ “wasted
   effort”.</p>

        <header>Conclusion</header>
        <p>Technical documentation must start with the designing
   of the product to be more effective.</p> 
        <p>Well-structured
   technical documentation created using new tools and
   technologies with correct data can reduce a lot of effort
   put in during development as well as operation and also
   reduce product downtime. It can also reduce
   incidents/accidents during the product life cycle if correct
   and logical content is incorporated and followed
   properly.</p>
        <p>As newer tools and technologies have made
   technical documentation platform neutral and easy
   to access and share across the organization, most
   manufacturers are integrating technical documentation
   in the product manufacturing stage to avail of the
   associated benefits and advantages.</p>

         <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
         condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
         Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
         condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
         statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
         including further nested if statements.
         <p>
           You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
           conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
         </p>
         <code
           >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
           } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
         </code>
         In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
         evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
         them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
         to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
   
         <code
           >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
           statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
           statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
           statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
         >
         It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
         because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
         the code. For example, do not use the following code:
         <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an
         assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
         additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
   
         <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
